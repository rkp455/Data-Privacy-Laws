**Current legislation**
The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, abbreviated GDPR) is a European Union regulation on information privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It also governs the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA. The GDPR's goals are to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal information and to simplify the regulations for international business. It supersedes the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and, among other things, simplifies the terminology.

The European Parliament and Council of the European Union adopted the GDPR on 14 April 2016, to become effective on 25 May 2018. As an EU regulation (instead of a directive), GDPR is directly applicable with force of law on its own without the need of transposition. However, it also provides flexibility for individual member states to modify (derogate from) some of its provisions.

The regulation became a model for many other laws around the world, including in Turkey, Mauritius, Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Argentina and Kenya. After leaving the European Union the United Kingdom enacted its "UK GDPR", identical to the GDPR. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), adopted on 28 June 2018, has many similarities with the GDPR.

**Contents**
The GDPR 2016 has eleven chapters, concerning general provisions, principles, rights of the data subject, duties of data controllers or processors, transfers of personal data to third countries, supervisory authorities, cooperation among member states, remedies, liability or penalties for breach of rights, and miscellaneous final provisions. Recital 4 proclaims that ‘processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind’.

**General provisions**
The regulation applies if the data controller (an organisation that collects information about living people, whether they are in the EU or not), or processor (an organisation that processes data on behalf of a data controller like cloud service providers), or the data subject (person) is based in the EU. Under certain circumstances, the regulation also applies to organisations based outside the EU if they collect or process personal data of individuals located inside the EU. The regulation does not apply to the processing of data by a person for a "purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity." (Recital 18).

According to the European Commission, "Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. If you cannot directly identify an individual from that information, then you need to consider whether the individual is still identifiable. You should take into account the information you are processing together with all the means reasonably likely to be used by either you or any other person to identify that individual." The precise definitions of terms such as "personal data", "processing", "data subject", "controller", and "processor" are stated in Article 4 of the Regulation.

The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; however, industry groups concerned about facing a potential conflict of laws have questioned whether Article 48 of the GDPR could be invoked to seek to prevent a data controller subject to a third country's laws from complying with a legal order from that country's law enforcement, judicial, or national security authorities to disclose to such authorities the personal data of an EU person, regardless of whether the data resides in or out of the EU. Article 48 states that any judgement of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may not be recognised or enforceable in any manner unless based on an international agreement, like a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third (non-EU) country and the EU or a member state. The data protection reform package also includes a separate Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector that provides rules on personal data exchanges at State level, Union level, and international levels.

A single set of rules applies to all EU member states. Each member state establishes an independent supervisory authority (SA) to hear and investigate complaints, sanction administrative offenses, etc. SAs in each member state cooperate with other SAs, providing mutual assistance and organizing joint operations. If a business has multiple establishments in the EU, it has a single SA as its "lead authority", based on the location of its "main establishment" where the main processing activities take place. The lead authority thus acts as a "one-stop shop" to supervise all processing activities of that business throughout the EU.

**Rights of the data subject**
The GDPR sets out the following rights for individuals:
- The right to be informed;
- The right of access;
- The right to rectification;
- The right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’);
- The right to restrict processing;
- The right to data portability;
- The right to object;
- Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

**Responsibilities of data controllers and processors**
Data controllers are responsible for implementing measures to ensure compliance with all principles of the GDPR, including being able to demonstrate such compliance. These measures include:
- Data protection by design and by default;
- Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs);
- Appointment of a data protection officer (DPO) (depending on the scale and nature of processing);
- Implementing measures that meet the principles of data protection, such as pseudonymization (replacing information in such a way that a data subject cannot be identified without additional information that is held separately) and encryption (coding information so that only authorized parties can read it).

Data processors must also implement appropriate measures and be able to demonstrate compliance with GDPR principles.

**Transfers of personal data to third countries**
Transfers of personal data outside the EU and EEA regions are allowed if certain conditions are met. Adequacy decisions, where the European Commission has decided that a third country, a territory, or a specific sector within a third country, or an international organization ensures an adequate level of protection, are among these conditions. The Privacy Shield framework, which was determined by the European Commission to provide adequate protection when personal data is transferred from the EU to the United States, was deemed invalid by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July 2020. In the absence of an adequacy decision, personal data may be transferred if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards and enforceable rights and remedies, such as standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules in the case of transfers within a corporate group, or approved codes of conduct and certifications.

**Supervisory authorities**
Each EU member state must provide for one or more independent public authorities to be responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the EU. These supervisory authorities (SAs) cooperate with each other and the European Data Protection Board to ensure consistency in their application of the GDPR.

**Remedies, liability, and penalties**
Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of the GDPR has the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered. Controllers and processors may be subject to administrative fines, which are imposed by supervisory authorities, depending on the circumstances of each case. In the most serious cases, such as violations of basic principles for processing, the fines can be up to €20 million or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Less severe infringements can result in fines of up to €10 million or, in the case of a company, up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.

**Compliance**
The GDPR requires organizations to implement policies, procedures, and technologies to protect personal data. Organizations must conduct privacy impact assessments for any new technologies or data processing that may pose a risk to individuals' privacy, and they must implement data protection measures into their development of new products and services. Organizations must also implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data, the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services, the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident, and a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

**Role of the data protection officer**
The GDPR requires the appointment of a data protection officer (DPO) for certain types of organizations, such as public authorities or organizations whose core activities involve processing personal data on a large scale. The DPO is responsible for overseeing the organization's data protection strategy, implementing policies, and ensuring compliance with the GDPR. The DPO also serves as a point of contact between the organization and its supervisory authority, and individuals can contact the DPO with any questions or concerns about the organization's data protection practices.

**Impact**
The GDPR has had a significant impact on data protection practices around the world. Many organizations have had to update their policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the GDPR's requirements, and individuals have gained greater control over their personal data. The GDPR has also led to increased awareness of data protection issues and the importance of protecting personal data. However, some critics argue that the GDPR is overly burdensome for businesses and that it has led to a proliferation of consent requests and privacy notices that are confusing for individuals. Overall, the GDPR represents a major step forward in data protection law and has set a new standard for data protection around the world.

**Reform**
The GDPR is part of the EU's broader reform of data protection law, which also includes the Data Protection Directive for the police and criminal justice sector. The EU has also adopted the Law Enforcement Directive, which sets out rules for the processing of personal data by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data.

**Criticism**
The GDPR has been criticized by some for being overly prescriptive and burdensome for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Critics argue that the GDPR's requirements, such as the obligation to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) and conduct privacy impact assessments (PIAs), are too onerous and costly for SMEs to comply with. Some also argue that the GDPR's emphasis on individual rights, such as the right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’) and the right to data portability, has led to a proliferation of data subject access requests (DSARs) and other requests from individuals, which can be time-consuming and costly for businesses to process.

**Support**
Supporters of the GDPR argue that it provides essential protections for individuals' privacy and data protection rights in the digital age. They argue that the GDPR's requirements, such as the principles of data protection by design and by default, the obligation to conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), and the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, are essential for protecting individuals' personal data from misuse and abuse. Supporters also argue that the GDPR's emphasis on transparency, accountability, and individual rights is essential for building trust and confidence in the digital economy.

**Impact on businesses**
The GDPR has had a significant impact on businesses around the world, particularly those that process personal data of individuals in the EU. Many businesses have had to update their policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the GDPR's requirements, such as the principles of data protection by design and by default, the obligation to conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), and the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk. Businesses that fail to comply with the GDPR's requirements can face fines of up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover, whichever is higher, as well as other sanctions, such as orders to stop processing personal data or to rectify or erase personal data.

**Conclusion**
The GDPR represents a major step forward in data protection law and has set a new standard for data protection around the world. It has strengthened individuals' privacy and data protection rights and has imposed new obligations on businesses that process personal data. While the GDPR has been criticized by some for being overly prescriptive and burdensome for businesses, particularly SMEs, supporters argue that it provides essential protections for individuals' privacy and data protection rights in the digital age. Overall, the GDPR is likely to continue to have a significant impact on data protection practices around the world for years to come.

# California Consumer Privacy Act

**From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia**

**California Consumer Privacy Act**

- **California State Legislature**
  - **Full name:** California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
  - **Introduced:** January 3, 2018
  - **Signed into law:** June 28, 2018
  - **Governor:** Jerry Brown
  - **Code:** California Civil Code
  - **Section:** 1798.100
  - **Resolution:** AB-375 (2017–2018 Session)
  - **Website:** [Assembly Bill No. 375](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375)
  - **Status:** Current legislation

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of the state of California in the United States. The bill was passed by the California State Legislature and signed into law by the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, on June 28, 2018, to amend Part 4 of Division 3 of the California Civil Code. Officially called AB-375, the act was introduced by Ed Chau, member of the California State Assembly, and State Senator Robert Hertzberg.

Amendments to the CCPA, in the form of Senate Bill 1121, were passed on September 13, 2018. Additional substantive amendments were signed into law on October 11, 2019. The CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. In November 2020, California voters passed Proposition 24, also known as the California Privacy Rights Act, which amends and expands the CCPA.

## Intentions of the Act

The intentions of the Act are to provide California residents with the right to:

- Know what personal data is being collected about them.
- Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.
- Say no to the sale of personal data.
- Access their personal data.
- Request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer.
- Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.

## Compliance

The CCPA applies to any business, including any for-profit entity that collects consumers' personal data, does business in California, and satisfies at least one of the following thresholds:

- Has annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million;
- Buys, receives, or sells the personal information of 100,000 or more consumers or households; or
- Earns more than half of its annual revenue from selling consumers' personal information.

Organizations are required to "implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices" in protecting consumer data.

The businesses that the CCPA refers to do not need to be physically present in California. As long as the business is active in the state and meets the requirements, they are considered to be under the CCPA. This includes transactions done on the Internet. In comparison to other privacy laws like the GDPR, the CCPA lacks clarity about its geographic range.

## Responsibility and Accountability

- Implement processes to obtain parental or guardian consent for minors under 13 years and the affirmative consent of minors between 13 and 16 years to data sharing for purposes (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.120(c)).
- "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link on the home page of the website of the business, that will direct users to a web page enabling them, or someone they authorize, to opt out of the sale of the resident's personal information (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.135(a)(1)).
- Designate methods for submitting data access requests, including, at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.130(a)).
- Update privacy policies with newly required information, including a description of California residents' rights (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.135(a)(2)).
- Avoid requesting opt-in consent for 12 months after a California resident opts out (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.135(a)(5)).

## Sanctions and Remedies

The following sanctions and remedies can be imposed:

- Companies, activists, associations, and others can be authorized to exercise opt-out rights on behalf of California residents (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.135(c)).
- Companies that become victims of data theft or other data security breaches can be ordered in civil class action lawsuits to pay statutory damages between $100 and $750 per California resident and incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater, and any other relief a court deems proper, subject to an option of the California Attorney General's Office to prosecute the company instead of allowing civil suits to be brought against it (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.150).
- A fine up to $7,500 for each intentional violation and $2,500 for each unintentional violation (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.155).
- Privacy notices must be accessible and have alternative format access clearly called out.
- Liability may also apply in respect of businesses in overseas countries who ship items into California.

The CCPA differs from the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act in that the former provides a private right of action, whereas the latter is enforced by the Attorney General's office.

## Definition of Personal Data

CCPA defines personal information as information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked (directly or indirectly) with a particular consumer or household such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver's license number, license plate number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.

An additional caveat identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, a particular individual, including, but not limited to, their name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information, or health insurance information.

It does not consider Publicly Available Information as personal.

Key differences between CCPA and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) include the scope and territorial reach of each, definitions related to protected information, levels of specificity, and an opt-out right for sales of personal information. CCPA differs in definition of personal information from GDPR as in some cases the CCPA only considers data that was provided by a consumer. The GDPR does not make that distinction and covers all personal data regardless of source. In the event of sensitive personal information, this does not apply if the information was manifestly made public by the data subject themselves, following the exception under Art.9(2),e). As such, the definition in GDPR is much broader than defined in the CCPA.

Personal data can also include online or social media profile information. Personal data is not limited to a number or a physical document but can also be online identities, accounts, and other personal information.

## History

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 was originally proposed as a ballot proposition by a privacy group known as Californians for Consumer Privacy. The California DOJ approved the initiative's official language on December 18, 2017, allowing the group to begin collecting signatures. In June 2018, the proponents gathered enough signatures to qualify the CCPA initiative for the November 2018 election. In California, the state legislature cannot repeal or amend a ballot proposition once it is passed by voters. In response to the CCPA ballot proposition, state legislators negotiated with Californians for Consumer Privacy to pass a less restrictive version of the CCPA in exchange for the withdrawal of the ballot proposition.

The CCPA was passed by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Brown on June 28, 2018; it became effective on January 1, 2020. The act's effect was dependent upon the withdrawal of initiative 17–0039, the Consumer Right to Privacy Act. Five amendments were enacted and signed by Gov. Newsom on October 11, 2019. Notice of DOJ's proposed regulations was also published October 11 in the Z Register; As of January 10, 2020 the OAL had not yet filed the final regulations with the Secretary of State, as required for the regulations to become effective.

The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 proposed several changes to the CCPA. The Act, also known as 2020 California Proposition 24, expands existing data privacy laws by allowing consumers greater control of their personal data and establishing the California Privacy Protection Agency. It passed, with a majority of voters approving the measure.

## Exemptions

- **Personal Health Information**
- **Financial information**

A big area of the CCPA exemption is the personal health information (PHI) that is gathered. Rather than the data being treated with the CCPA guidelines in mind, it is expected for PHI to adhere to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, otherwise known as HIPAA. If the business collecting the data is related to clinical trials, then it must adhere to the "Common Rule".

As for the information that is gathered by financial institutions, the institutions follow the California Financial Information Privacy act or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act depending on the situation.
